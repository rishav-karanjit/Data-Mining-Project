# Quality-Evaluation-of-Skull-Stripped-Brain-MRI-Images

Developed a Data Mining algorithm or tool to check the quality of the skull-stripped MRI images. This algorithm or tool meets the following requirements:

* Determined whether the facial features are removed to the extent that people cannot identify the person based on the remaining facial features in the skull-stripped MRI image.
* Determined the probability of the facial features removed to the extent that people cannot identify the person based on the remaining facial features in the skull-stripped MRI image.
* Determined whether any brain voxels are unintentionally removed, resulting in the loss of important brain information.
* Determined the probablity whether any brain voxels are unintentionally removed, resulting in the loss of important brain information.
